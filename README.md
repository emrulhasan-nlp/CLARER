## ðŸš€ How to Run the Model

### Step 1: Download the Dataset

Download the dataset from the following Google Drive link:  
ðŸ”— [Dataset Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yB-EFuApAOJ0RzTI0VfZ0pignytguU0_)

Place the `review.pickle` file inside each of the following folders:

- `tripAdvisor`
- `amazonTV`
- `yelp`

Your directory should look like this:

.
â”œâ”€â”€ rawdata/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ tripAdvisor/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ amazonTV/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ yelp/
â”œâ”€â”€ trip_preprocessing.py
â”œâ”€â”€ amztv_preprocessing.py
â”œâ”€â”€ yelp_preprocessing.py
â”œâ”€â”€ NRTPlus.py
â””â”€â”€ README.md

### Step 2: Preprocess the Datasets

Run the following scripts to preprocess the datasets. These scripts generate intermediate data required for model training.

```bash
python trip_preprocessing.py
python amztv_preprocessing.py
python yelp_preprocessing.py
```
