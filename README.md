# CLARER

**Contrastive Learning for Aspect Representation towards Explainable Recommendation**

CLARER is a model that utilizes contrastive learning to generate aspect-based representations from user reviews. These representations are then used for explainable recommendation tasks across different domains such as hotels, TVs, and restaurants.

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Model

### Step 1: Download the Dataset

Download the dataset from the following Google Drive link:  
ðŸ”— [Dataset Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yB-EFuApAOJ0RzTI0VfZ0pignytguU0_)

Place the `review.pickle` file inside each of the following folders:

- `tripAdvisor`
- `amazonTV`
- `yelp`

Your directory should look like this:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ rawdata/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tripAdvisor/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ OriginalReviews.json
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ review.pickle
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ amazonTV/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Movies_and_TV.json
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ review.pickle
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ yelp/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ yelp_academic_dataset_review.json
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ review.pickle
â”œâ”€â”€ prepdata/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tripAdvisor/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ tripdata.csv
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ amazonTV/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ amz_tv.csv
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ yelp/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ yelp.csv
â”œâ”€â”€ trip_preprocessing.py
â”œâ”€â”€ amztv_preprocessing.py
â”œâ”€â”€ yelp_preprocessing.py
â”œâ”€â”€ NRTPlus.py
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

---

### Step 2: Preprocess the Datasets

Run the following scripts to preprocess the datasets. These scripts generate intermediate data required for model training:

```bash
python trip_preprocessing.py
python amztv_preprocessing.py
python yelp_preprocessing.py
```

---

### Step 3: Run the Model

After preprocessing, use the following command to run the model:

```bash
python NRTPlus.py --dataset yelp.csv
```

> Replace `yelp.csv` with `tripdata.csv` or `amz_tv.csv` based on the dataset you're using.
